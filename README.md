Zomato Delivery Optimization Project

Project Overview

This project analyzes over **45,000 delivery records** from Zomato to uncover the key factors contributing to delivery delays. The study explores how **road traffic density**, **weather conditions**, **delivery personnel ratings**, and **vehicle conditions** affect delivery performance. 

By leveraging **R** and data visualization techniques, we identified critical insights to support **route optimization** and **operational improvements** in last-mile logistics.

Key Insights

- **Traffic Density:** High traffic correlates with longer delivery times.
- **Delivery Personnel Ratings:** Higher-rated riders tend to complete deliveries faster.
- **Vehicle Condition:** Does not drastically impact delivery time but shows some variability.
- **Festival Deliveries:** Higher load during festivals slightly affects efficiency.
- **Delivery Time Trends:** Line plots reveal fluctuations and potential bottlenecks over time.

Visualizations

- **Bar Plot:** Road Traffic vs. Delivery Time  
- **Scatter Plot:** Delivery Ratings vs. Delivery Time  
- **Box Plot:** Vehicle Condition vs. Delivery Time  
- **Pie Chart:** Festival vs. Non-Festival Deliveries  
- **Histogram:** Delivery Time Distribution  
- **Line Plot:** Average Delivery Time Over Dates  


Tools Used

- **Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`  
- **Environment:** RStudio  

Conclusion

The analysis highlights the need for strategic changes such as:
- **Route optimization** based on real-time traffic.
- **Performance monitoring** and incentive systems for delivery staff.
- **Operational planning** during festivals and high-demand periods.

These insights can significantly **boost delivery efficiency**, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing operational bottlenecks.
